The parameters are the pressure (1 bar) and the temperature (300 K). The barostat assumes the simulation is being run at constant temperature, but it does not itself do anything to regulate the temperature.

Otherwise, you will get incorrect results."

The checkpoint contains data that is highly specific to the System, Platform, and the hardware and software of the computer it was created on.
